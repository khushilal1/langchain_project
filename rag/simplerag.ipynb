Now the research community has started working on a harder task‚Äîusing it for video generation. The task itself is a superset of the image case, since an image is a video of 1 frame, and it is much more challenging because:\\n\\nIt has extra requirements on temporal consistency across frames in time, which naturally demands more world knowledge to be encoded into the model.\\nIn comparison to text or images, it is more difficult to collect large amounts of high-quality, high-dimensional video data, let along text-video pairs.\\n\\n\\n\\nü•ë Required Pre-read: Please make sure you have read the previous blog on ‚ÄúWhat are Diffusion Models?‚Äù for image generation before continue here.\\n\\n\\nVideo Generation Modeling from Scratch#\\nFirst let‚Äôs review approaches for designing and training diffusion video models from scratch, meaning that we do not rely on pre-trained image generators.\\nParameterization & Sampling Basics#\\nHere we use a slightly different variable definition from the previous post, but the math stays the same. Let $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim q_\\\\text{real}$ be a data point sampled from the real data distribution. Now we are adding Gaussian noise in small amount in time, creating a sequence of noisy variations of $\\\\mathbf{x}$, denoted as $\\\\{\\\\mathbf{z}_t \\\\mid t =1 \\\\dots, T\\\\}$, with increasing amount of noise as $t$ increases and the last $q(\\\\mathbf{z}_T) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{0}, \\\\mathbf{I})$. The noise-adding forward process is a Gaussian process. Let $\\\\alpha_t, \\\\sigma_t$ define a differentiable noise schedule of the Gaussian process:\\n\\n$$\\nq(\\\\mathbf{z}_t \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{z}_t; \\\\alpha_t \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\sigma^2_t\\\\mathbf{I})\\n$$\\n\\nTo represent $q(\\\\mathbf{z}_t \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{z}_s)$ for $0 \\\\leq s < t \\\\leq T$, we have:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\mathbf{z}_t &= \\\\alpha_t \\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\sigma_t\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}_t \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{z}_s &= \\\\alpha_s \\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\sigma_s\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}_s \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{z}_t &= \\\\alpha_t \\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{z}_s - \\\\sigma_s\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}_s}{\\\\alpha_s}\\\\Big) + \\\\sigma_t\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}_t \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{z}_t &= \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_t}{\\\\alpha_s}\\\\mathbf{z}_s + \\\\sigma_t\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}_t - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_t\\\\sigma_s}{\\\\alpha_s} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}_s \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{Thus }q(\\\\mathbf{z}_t \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{z}_s) &= \\\\mathcal{N}\\\\Big(\\\\mathbf{z}_t; \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_t}{\\\\alpha_s}\\\\mathbf{z}_s, \\\\big(1 - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2_t\\\\sigma^2_s}{\\\\sigma^2_t\\\\alpha^2_s}\\\\big)\\\\sigma^2_t \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\Big)\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nLet the log signal-to-noise-ratio be $\\\\lambda_t = \\\\log[\\\\alpha^2_t / \\\\sigma^2_t]$, we can represent the DDIM (Song et al. 2020) update as:\\n\\n$$\\nq(\\\\mathbf{z}_t \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{z}_s) = \\\\mathcal{N}\\\\Big(\\\\mathbf{z}_t; \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_t}{\\\\alpha_s}\\\\mathbf{z}_s, \\\\sigma^2_{t\\\\vert s} \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\Big) \\\\quad\\n\\\\text{where }\\\\sigma^2_{t\\\\vert s} = (1 - e^{\\\\lambda_t - \\\\lambda_s})\\\\sigma^2_t\\n$$\\n\\nThere is a special $\\\\mathbf{v}$-prediction ($\\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\alpha_t \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} - \\\\sigma_t \\\\mathbf{x}$) parameterization, proposed by Salimans & Ho (2022). It has been shown to be helpful for avoiding color shift in video generation compared to $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}$-parameterization.\\nThe $\\\\mathbf{v}$-parameterization is derived with a trick in the angular coordinate. First, we define $\\\\phi_t = \\\\arctan(\\\\sigma_t / \\\\alpha_t)$ and thus we have $\\\\alpha_\\\\phi = \\\\cos\\\\phi, \\\\sigma_t = \\\\sin\\\\phi, \\\\mathbf{z}_\\\\phi = \\\\cos\\\\phi \\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\sin\\\\phi\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}$. The velocity of $\\\\mathbf{z}_\\\\phi$ can be written as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\phi = \\\\nabla_\\\\phi \\\\mathbf{z}_\\\\phi = \\\\frac{d\\\\cos\\\\phi}{d\\\\phi} \\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\frac{d\\\\sin\\\\phi}{d\\\\phi}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\cos\\\\phi\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} -\\\\sin\\\\phi\\\\mathbf{x}\\n$$\\n\\nThen we can infer,\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\sin\\\\phi\\\\mathbf{x} \\n&= \\\\cos\\\\phi\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}  - \\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\phi \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\phi}{\\\\sin\\\\phi}\\\\big(\\\\mathbf{z}_\\\\phi - \\\\cos\\\\phi\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\big) - \\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\phi \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\sin^2\\\\phi\\\\mathbf{x} \\n&= \\\\cos\\\\phi\\\\mathbf{z}_\\\\phi - \\\\cos^2\\\\phi\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\phi \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{x} &= \\\\cos\\\\phi\\\\mathbf{z}_\\\\phi - \\\\sin\\\\phi\\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\phi \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{Similarly }\\n\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} &= \\\\sin\\\\phi\\\\mathbf{z}_\\\\phi + \\\\cos\\\\phi \\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\phi\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nThe DDIM update rule is updated accordingly,\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_s} \\n&= \\\\cos\\\\phi_s\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_\\\\theta(\\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_t}) + \\\\sin\\\\phi_s\\\\hat{\\\\epsilon}_\\\\theta(\\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_t}) \\\\quad\\\\quad{\\\\small \\\\text{; }\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_\\\\theta(.), \\\\hat{\\\\epsilon}_\\\\theta(.)\\\\text{ are two models to predict }\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}\\\\text{ based on }\\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_t}}\\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\cos\\\\phi_s \\\\big( \\\\cos\\\\phi_t \\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_t} - \\\\sin\\\\phi_t \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{v}}_\\\\theta(\\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_t} ) \\\\big) +\\n\\\\sin\\\\phi_s \\\\big( \\\\sin\\\\phi_t \\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_t} + \\\\cos\\\\phi_t \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{v}}_\\\\theta(\\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_t} ) \\\\big) \\\\\\\\\\n&= {\\\\color{red} \\\\big( \\\\cos\\\\phi_s\\\\cos\\\\phi_t + \\\\sin\\\\phi_s\\\\sin\\\\phi_t \\\\big)} \\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_t} + \\n{\\\\color{green} \\\\big( \\\\sin\\\\phi_s \\\\cos\\\\phi_t - \\\\cos\\\\phi_s \\\\sin\\\\phi_t \\\\big)} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{v}}_\\\\theta(\\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_t} ) \\\\\\\\\\n&= {\\\\color{red} cos(\\\\phi_s - \\\\phi_t)} \\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_t} +\\n{\\\\color{green} \\\\sin(\\\\phi_s - \\\\phi_t)} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{v}}_\\\\theta(\\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_t}) \\\\quad\\\\quad{\\\\small \\\\text{; trigonometric identity functions.}}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Visualizing how the diffusion update step works in the angular coordinate, where DDIM evolves $\\\\mathbf{z}_{\\\\phi_s}$ by moving it along the $-\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{v}}_{\\\\phi_t}$ direction. (Image source: Salimans & Ho, 2022)\\nThe $\\\\mathbf{v}$-parameterization for the model is to predict $\\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\phi = \\\\cos\\\\phi\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} -\\\\sin\\\\phi\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\alpha_t\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} - \\\\sigma_t\\\\mathbf{x}$.\\nIn the case of video generation, we need the diffusion model to run multiple steps of upsampling for extending video length or increasing the frame rate. This requires the capability of sampling a second video $\\\\mathbf{x}^b$ conditioned on the first $\\\\mathbf{x}^a$, $\\\\mathbf{x}^b \\\\sim p_\\\\theta(\\\\mathbf{x}^b \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{x}^a)$, where $\\\\mathbf{x}^b$ might be an autoregressive extension of $\\\\mathbf{x}^a$ or be the missing frames in-between for a video $\\\\mathbf{x}^a$ at a low frame rate.\\nThe sampling of $\\\\mathbf{x}_b$ needs to condition on $\\\\mathbf{x}_a$ besides its own corresponding noisy variable. Video Diffusion Models (VDM; Ho & Salimans, et al. 2022) proposed the reconstruction guidance method using an adjusted denoising model such that the sampling of $\\\\mathbf{x}^b$ can be properly conditioned on $\\\\mathbf{x}^a$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\mathbb{E}_q [\\\\mathbf{x}_b \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{z}_t, \\\\mathbf{x}^a] &= \\\\mathbb{E}_q [\\\\mathbf{x}^b \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{z}_t] + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_t^2}{\\\\alpha_t} \\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{z}^b_t} \\\\log q(\\\\mathbf{x}^a \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{z}_t) \\\\\\\\\\nq(\\\\mathbf{x}^a \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{z}_t) &\\\\approx \\\\mathcal{N}\\\\big[\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^a_\\\\theta (\\\\mathbf{z}_t), \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_t^2}{\\\\alpha_t^2}\\\\mathbf{I}\\\\big] & {\\\\small \\\\text{; the closed form is unknown.}}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{x}}^b_\\\\theta (\\\\mathbf{z}_t) &= \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^b_\\\\theta (\\\\mathbf{z}_t) - \\\\frac{w_r \\\\alpha_t}{2} \\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{z}_t^b} \\\\| \\\\mathbf{x}^a - \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^a_\\\\theta (\\\\mathbf{z}_t) \\\\|^2_2 & {\\\\small \\\\text{; an adjusted denoising model for }\\\\mathbf{x}^b}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^a_\\\\theta (\\\\mathbf{z}_t), \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^b_\\\\theta (\\\\mathbf{z}_t)$ are reconstructions of $\\\\mathbf{x}^a, \\\\mathbf{x}^b$ provided by the denoising model. And $w_r$ is a weighting factor and a large one $w_r >1$ is found to improve sample quality. Note that it is also possible to simultaneously condition on low resolution videos to extend samples to be at the high resolution using the same reconstruction guidance method.\\nModel Architecture: 3D U-Net & DiT#\\nSimilar to text-to-image diffusion models, U-net and Transformer are still two common architecture choices. There are a series of diffusion video modeling papers from Google based on the U-net architecture and a recent Sora model from OpenAI leveraged the Transformer architecture.\\nVDM (Ho & Salimans, et al. 2022) adopts the standard diffusion model setup but with an altered architecture suitable for video modeling. It extends the 2D U-net to work for 3D data (Cicek et al. 2016), where each feature map represents a 4D tensor of frames x height x width x channels. This 3D U-net is factorized over space and time, meaning that each layer only operates on the space or time dimension, but not both:\\n\\nProcessing Space:\\n\\nEach old 2D convolution layer as in the 2D U-net is extended to be space-only 3D convolution; precisely, 3x3 convolutions become 1x3x3 convolutions.\\nEach spatial attention block remains as attention over space, where the first axis (frames) is treated as batch dimension.\\n\\n\\nProcessing Time:\\n\\nA temporal attention block is added after each spatial attention block. It performs attention over the first axis (frames) and treats spatial axes as the batch dimension. The relative position embedding is used for tracking the order of frames. The temporal attention block is important for the model to capture good temporal coherence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 2. The 3D U-net architecture. The noisy video $\\\\mathbf{z}_t$ , conditioning information $\\\\boldsymbol{c}$ and the log signal-to-noise ratio (log-SNR) $\\\\lambda_t$ are inputs to the network. The channel multipliers $M_1, \\\\dots, M_K$ represent the channel counts across layers. (Image source: Salimans & Ho, 2022)\\nImagen Video (Ho, et al. 2022) is constructed on a cascade of diffusion models to enhance the video generation quality and upgrades to output 1280x768 videos at 24 fps. The Imagen Video architecture consists of the following components, counting 7 diffusion models in total.\\n\\nA frozen T5 text encoder to provide text embedding as the conditioning input.\\nA base video diffusion model.\\nA cascade of interleaved spatial and temporal super-resolution diffusion models, including 3 TSR (Temporal Super-Resolution) and 3 SSR (Spatial Super-Resolution) components.\\n\\n\\nFig. 3. The cascaded sampling pipeline in Imagen Video. In practice, the text embeddings are injected into all components, not just the base model. (Image source: Ho et al. 2022)\\nThe base denoising models performs spatial operations over all the frames with shared parameters simultaneously and then the temporal layer mixes activations across frames to better capture temporal coherence, which is found to work better than frame-autoregressive approaches.\\n\\nFig. 4. The architecture of one space-time separable block in the Imagen Video diffusion model. (Image source: Ho et al. 2022)\\nBoth SSR and TSR models condition on the upsampled inputs concatenated with noisy data $\\\\mathbf{z}_t$ channel-wise. SSR upsamples by bilinear resizing, while TSR upsamples by repeating the frames or filling in blank frames.\\nImagen Video also applies progressive distillation to speed up sampling and each distillation iteration can reduce the required sampling steps by half. Their experiments were able to distill all 7 video diffusion models down to just 8 sampling steps per model without any noticeable loss in perceptual quality.\\n\\nTo achieve better scaling efforts, Sora (Brooks et al. 2024) leverages DiT (Diffusion Transformer) architecture that operates on spacetime patches of video and image latent codes. Visual input is represented as a sequence of spacetime patches which act as Transformer input tokens.\\n\\nFig. 5. Sora is a diffusion transformer model.(Image source: Brooks et al. 2024)\\nAdapting Image Models to Generate Videos#\\nAnother prominent approach for diffusion video modeling is to ‚Äúinflate‚Äù a pre-trained image-to-text diffusion model by inserting temporal layers and then we can choose to only fine-tune new layers on video data, or avoid extra training at all. The prior knowledge of text-image pairs is inherited by the new model and thus it can help alleviate the requirement on text-video pair data.\\nFine-tuning on Video Data#\\nMake-A-Video (Singer et al. 2022) extends a pre-trained diffusion image model with a temporal dimension, consisting of three key components:\\n\\nA base text-to-image model trained on text-image pair data.\\nSpatiotemporal convolution and attention layers to extend the network to cover temporal dimension.\\nA frame interpolation network for high frame rate generation\\n\\n\\nFig. 6. The illustration of Make-A-Video pipeline.(Image source: Singer et al. 2022)\\nThe final video inference scheme can be formulated as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{y}}_t = \\\\text{SR}_h \\\\circ \\\\text{SR}^t_l \\\\circ \\\\uparrow_F \\\\circ D^t \\\\circ P \\\\circ (\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}, \\\\text{CLIP}_\\\\text{text}(\\\\mathbf{x}))\\n$$\\n\\nwhere:\\n\\n$\\\\mathbf{x}$ is the input text.\\n$\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}$ is the BPE-encoded text.\\n$\\\\text{CLIP}_\\\\text{text}(.)$ is the CLIP text encoder, $\\\\mathbf{x}_e = \\\\text{CLIP}_\\\\text{text}(\\\\mathbf{x})$.\\n$P(.)$ is the prior, generating image embedding $\\\\mathbf{y}_e$ given text embedding $\\\\mathbf{x}_e$ and BPE encoded text $\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}$ : $\\\\mathbf{y}_e = P(\\\\mathbf{x}_e, \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}})$. This part is trained on text-image pair data and not fine-tuned on video data.\\n$D^t(.)$ is the spatiotemporal decoder that generates a series of 16 frames, where each frame is a low-resolution 64x64 RGB image $\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{y}}_l$.\\n$\\\\uparrow_F(.)$ is the frame interpolation network, increasing the effective frame rate by interpolating between generated frames. This is a fine-tuned model for the task of predicting masked frames for video upsampling.\\n$\\\\text{SR}_h(.), \\\\text{SR}^t_l(.)$ are the spatial and spatiotemporal super-resolution models, increasing the image resolution to 256x256 and 768x768, respectively.\\n$\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{y}}_t$ is the final generated video.\\n\\nSpatiotemporal SR layers contain pseudo-3D convo layers and pseudo-3D attention layers:\\n\\nPseudo-3D convo layer : Each spatial 2D convo layer (initialized from the pre-training image model) is followed by a temporal 1D layer (initialized as the identity function). Conceptually, the convo 2D layer first generates multiple frames and then frames are reshaped to be a video clip.\\nPseudo-3D attention layer: Following each (pre-trained) spatial attention layer, a temporal attention layer is stacked and used to approximate a full spatiotemporal attention layer.\\n\\n\\nFig. 7. How pseudo-3D convolution (left) and attention (right) layers work.(Image source: Singer et al. 2022)\\nThey can be represented as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\text{Conv}_\\\\text{P3D} &= \\\\text{Conv}_\\\\text{1D}(\\\\text{Conv}_\\\\text{2D}(\\\\mathbf{h}) \\\\circ T) \\\\circ T \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{Attn}_\\\\text{P3D} &= \\\\text{flatten}^{-1}(\\\\text{Attn}_\\\\text{1D}(\\\\text{Attn}_\\\\text{2D}(\\\\text{flatten}(\\\\mathbf{h})) \\\\circ T) \\\\circ T)\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere an input tensor $\\\\mathbf{h} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{B\\\\times C \\\\times F \\\\times H \\\\times W}$  (corresponding to batch size, channels, frames, height and weight); and $\\\\circ T$ swaps between temporal and spatial dimensions; $\\\\text{flatten}(.)$ is a matrix operator to convert $\\\\mathbf{h}$ to be $\\\\mathbf{h}‚Äô \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{B \\\\times C \\\\times F \\\\times HW}$ and $\\\\text{flatten}^{-1}(.)$ reverses that process.\\nDuring training, different components of Make-A-Video pipeline are trained independently.\\n\\nDecoder $D^t$, prior $P$ and two super-resolution components $\\\\text{SR}_h, \\\\text{SR}^t_l$ are first trained on images alone, without paired text.\\nNext the new temporal layers are added, initialized as identity function, and then fine-tuned on unlabeled video data.\\n\\nTune-A-Video (Wu et al. 2023) inflates a pre-trained image diffusion model to enable one-shot video tuning: Given a video containing $m$ frames, $\\\\mathcal{V} = \\\\{v_i \\\\mid i = 1, \\\\dots, m\\\\}$, paired with a descriptive prompt $\\\\tau$, the task is to generate a new video $\\\\mathcal{V}^*$ based on a slightly edited & related text prompt $\\\\tau^*$. For example, $\\\\tau$ = \"A man is skiing\" can be extended to $\\\\tau^*$=\"Spiderman is skiing on the beach\". Tune-A-Video is meant to be used for object editing, background change, and style transfer.\\nBesides inflating the 2D convo layer, the U-Net architecture of Tune-A-Video incorporates the ST-Attention (spatiotemporal attention) block to capture temporal consistency by querying relevant positions in previous frames. Given latent features of frame $v_i$, previous frames $v_{i-1}$ and the first frame $v_1$ are projected to query $\\\\mathbf{Q}$, key $\\\\mathbf{K}$ and value $\\\\mathbf{V}$, the ST-attention is defined as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n&\\\\mathbf{Q} = \\\\mathbf{W}^Q \\\\mathbf{z}_{v_i}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{K} = \\\\mathbf{W}^K [\\\\mathbf{z}_{v_1}, \\\\mathbf{z}_{v_{i-1}}], \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{V} = \\\\mathbf{W}^V [\\\\mathbf{z}_{v_1}, \\\\mathbf{z}_{v_{i-1}}] \\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\mathbf{O} = \\\\text{softmax}\\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{Q} \\\\mathbf{K}^\\\\top}{\\\\sqrt{d}}\\\\Big) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{V}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. The Tune-A-Video architecture overview. It first runs a light-weighted fine-tuning stage on a single video before the sampling stage. Note that the entire temporal self-attention (T-Attn) layers get fine-tuned because they are newly added, but only query projections in ST-Attn and Cross-Attn are updated during fine-tuning to preserve prior text-to-image knowledge. ST-Attn improves spatial-temporal consistency, Cross-Attn refines text-video alignment. (Image source: Wu et al. 2023)\\nGen-1 model  (Esser et al. 2023) by Runway targets the task of editing a given video according to text inputs. It decomposes the consideration of structure and content of a video $p(\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\mid s, c)$ for generation conditioning. However, to do a clear decomposition of these two aspects is not easy.\\n\\nContent $c$ refers to appearance and semantics of the video, that is sampled from the text for conditional editing. CLIP embedding of the frame is a good representation of content, and stays largely orthogonal to structure traits.\\nStructure $s$ depicts greometry and dynamics, including shapes, locations, temporal changes of objects, and $s$ is sampled from the input video. Depth estimation or other task-specific side information (e.g. human body pose or face landmarks for human video synthesis) can be used.\\n\\nThe architecture changes in Gen-1 are quite standard, i.e. adding 1D temporal convo layer after each 2D spatial convo layer in its residual blocks and adding 1D temporal attention block after each 2D spatial attention block in its attention blocks. During training, the structure variable $s$ is concatenated with the diffusion latent variable $\\\\mathbf{z}$, where the content variable $c$ is provided in the cross-attention layer. At inference time, the clip embedding is converted via a prior to convert CLIP text embedding to be CLIP image embedding.\\n\\nFig. 9. The overview of the Gen-1 model training pipeline.(Image source: Esser et al. 2023)\\nVideo LDM (Blattmann et al. 2023) trains a LDM (Latent diffusion models) image generator first. Then the model is fine-tuned to produce videos with a temporal dimension added. The fine-tuning only applies to these newly added temporal layers on encoded image sequences. The temporal layers $\\\\{l^i_\\\\phi \\\\mid i = \\\\ 1, \\\\dots, L\\\\}$ in the Video LDM (See Fig. 10) are interleaved with existing spatial layers $l^i_\\\\theta$ which stays frozen during fine-tuning. That‚Äôs being said, we only fine-tune the new parameters $\\\\phi$ but not the pre-trained image backbone model parameters $\\\\theta$. The pipeline of Video LDM first generates key frames at low fps and then processes through 2 steps of latent frame interpolations to increase fps.\\nThe input sequence of length $T$ is interpreted as a batch of images (i.e. $B \\\\cdot T$) for the base image model $\\\\theta$ and then gets reshaped into video format for $l^i_\\\\phi$ temporal layers. There is a skip connection leads to a combination of temporal layer output $\\\\mathbf{z}‚Äô$ and the spatial output $\\\\mathbf{z}$ via a learned merging parameter $\\\\alpha$. There are two types of temporal mixing layers implemented in practice: (1) temporal attention and (2) residual blocks based on 3D convolutions.\\n\\nFig. 10. A pre-training LDM for image synthesis is extended to be a video generator. $B, T, C, H, W$ are batch size, sequence length, channels, height and width, respectively. $\\\\mathbf{c}_S$ is an optional conditioning/context frame. (Image source: Blattmann et al. 2023)\\nHowever, there is a remaining issue with LDM‚Äôs pretrainined autoencoder which only sees images never videos. Naively using that for video generation can cause flickering artifacts without good temporal coherence. So Video LDM adds additional temporal layers into the decoder and fine-tuned on video data with a patch-wise temporal discriminator built from 3D convolutions, while the encoder remains unchanged so that we still can reuse the pretrained LDM. During temporal decoder fine-tuning, the frozen encoder processes each frame in the video independently, and enforce temporally coherent reconstructions across frames with a video-aware discriminator.\\n\\nFig. 11. The training pipeline of autoencoder in video latent diffusion models. The decoder is fine-tuned to have temporal coherency with a new across-frame discriminator while the encoder stays frozen. (Image source: Blattmann et al. 2023)\\nSimilar to Video LDM, the architecture design of Stable Video Diffusion (SVD; Blattmann et al. 2023) is also based on LDM with temporal layers inserted after every spatial convolution and attention layer, but SVD fine-tunes the entire model. There are three stages for training video LDMs:\\n\\nText-to-image pretraining is important and helps improve both quality and prompt following.\\nVideo pretraining is beneficial to be separated and should ideally occur on a larger scale, curated dataset.\\nHigh-quality video finetuning works with a smaller, pre-captioned video of high visual fidelity.\\n\\nSVD specially emphasizes the critical role of dataset curation in model performance. They applied a cut detection pipeline to get more cuts per video and then applied three different captioner models: (1) CoCa for mid-frame, (2) V-BLIP for a video caption, and (3) LLM based captioning based on previous two captions. Then they were able to continue to improve video datasets, by removing clips with less motion (filtered by low optical flow scores calculated at 2 fps), excessive text presence (apply optical character recognition to identify videos with lots of text), or generally low aesthetic value (annotate the first, middle, and last frames of each clip with CLIP embeddings and calculate aesthetics scores & text-image similarities). The experiments showed that a filtered, higher quality dataset leads to better model quality, even when this dataset is much smaller.\\nThe key challenge of generating distant key frames first and then adding interpolation with temporal super-resolution is how to maintain high-quality temporal consistency. Lumiere (Bar-Tal et al. 2024) instead adopts a space-time U-Net (STUNet) architecture that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once through a single pass, removing the dependency on TSR (temporal super-resolution) components. STUNet downsamples the video in both time and space dimensions and thus expensive computation happens in a compact time-space latent space.\\n\\nFig. 12. Lumiere removes TSR (temporal super-resolution) models. The inflated SSR network can operate only on short segments of the video due to memory constraints and thus SSR models operate on a set of shorter but overlapped video snippets. (Image source: Bar-Tal et al. 2024)\\nSTUNet inflates a pretrained text-to-image U-net to be able to downsample and upsample videos at both time and space dimensions. Convo-based blocks consist of pre-trained text-to-image layers, followed by a factorized space-time convolution. And attention-based blocks at the coarsest U-Net level contains the pre-trained text-to-image, followed by temporal attention. Further training only happens with the newly added layers.\\n\\nFig. 13.

Text2Video-Zero (Khachatryan et al. 2023) enables zero-shot, training-free video generation by enhancing a pre-trained image diffusion model with two key mechanisms for temporal consistency:\\n\\nSampling the sequence of latent codes with motion dynamics to keep the global scene and the background time consistent;\\nReprogramming frame-level self-attention using a new cross-frame attention of each frame on the first frame, to preserve the context, appearance, and identity of the foreground object.\\n\\n\\nFig. 14. An overview of the Text2Video-Zero pipeline. (Image source: Khachatryan et al. 2023)\\nThe process of sampling a sequence of latent variables, $\\\\mathbf{x}^1_T, \\\\dots, \\\\mathbf{x}^m_T$, with motion information is described as follows:\\n\\nDefine a direction $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta} = (\\\\delta_x, \\\\delta_y) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^2$ for controlling the global scene and camera motion; by default, we set $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta} = (1, 1)$. Also define a hyperparameter $\\\\lambda > 0$ controlling the amount of global motion.\\nFirst sample the latent code of the first frame at random, $\\\\mathbf{x}^1_T \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0, I)$;\\nPerform $\\\\Delta t \\\\geq 0$ DDIM backward update steps using the pre-trained image diffusion model, e.g. Stable Diffusion (SD) model in the paper, and obtain the corresponding latent code $\\\\mathbf{x}^1_{T‚Äô}$ where $T‚Äô = T - \\\\Delta t$.\\nFor each frame in the latent code sequence, we apply corresponding motion translation with a warping operation defined by $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}^k = \\\\lambda(k-1)\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}$ to obtain $\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{x}}^k_{T‚Äô}$.\\nFinally apply DDIM forward steps to all $\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{2:m}_{T‚Äô}$ to obtain $\\\\mathbf{x}^{2:m}_T$.\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\mathbf{x}^1_{T\\'} &= \\\\text{DDIM-backward}(\\\\mathbf{x}^1_T, \\\\Delta t)\\\\text{ where }T\\' = T - \\\\Delta t \\\\\\\\\\nW_k &\\\\gets \\\\text{a warping operation of }\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}^k = \\\\lambda(k-1)\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{x}}^k_{T\\'} &= W_k(\\\\mathbf{x}^1_{T\\'})\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{x}^k_T &= \\\\text{DDIM-forward}(\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{x}}^k_{T\\'}, \\\\Delta t)\\\\text{ for }k=2, \\\\dots, m\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nBesides, Text2Video-Zero replaces the self-attention layer in a pre-trained SD model with a new cross-frame attention mechanism with reference to the first frame. The motivation is to preserve the information about the foreground object‚Äôs appearance, shape, and identity throughout the generated video.\\n \\n$$\\n\\\\text{Cross-Frame-Attn}(\\\\mathbf{Q}^k, \\\\mathbf{K}^{1:m}, \\\\mathbf{V}^{1:m}) = \\\\text{Softmax}\\\\Big( \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{Q}^k (\\\\mathbf{K}^1)^\\\\top}{\\\\sqrt{c}} \\\\Big) \\\\mathbf{V}^1\\n$$\\n\\nOptionally, the background mask can be used to further smoothen and improve background consistency. Let‚Äôs say, we obtain a corresponding foreground mask $\\\\mathbf{M}_k$ for the $k$-th frame using some existing method, and background smoothing merges the actual and the warped latent code at the diffusion step $t$, w.r.t. the background matrix:\\n \\n$$\\n\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{x}}^k_t = \\\\mathbf{M}^k \\\\odot \\\\mathbf{x}^k_t + (1 ‚àí \\\\mathbf{M}^k) \\\\odot (\\\\alpha\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{x}}^k_t +(1‚àí\\\\alpha)\\\\mathbf{x}^k_t)\\\\quad\\\\text{for }k=1, \\\\dots, m\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{x}^k_t$ is the actual latent code and $\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{x}}^k_t$ is the warped latent code on the background; $\\\\alpha$ is a hyperparameter and the papers set $\\\\alpha=0.6$ in the experiments.\\nText2video-zero can be combined with ControlNet where the ControlNet pretrained copy branch is applied per frame on each $\\\\mathbf{x}^k_t$ for $k = 1, \\\\dots, m$ in each diffusion time-step $t = T , \\\\dots, 1$ and add the ControlNet branch outputs to the skip-connections of the main U-net.\\nControlVideo (Zhang et al. 2023) aims to generate videos conditioned on text prompt $\\\\tau$ and a motion sequence (e.g., depth or edge maps), $\\\\mathbf{c} = \\\\{c^i\\\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$. It is adapted from ControlNet with three new mechanisms added:\\n\\nCross-frame attention: Adds fully cross-frame interaction in self-attention modules. It introduces interactions between all the frames, by mapping the latent frames at all the time steps into $\\\\mathbf{Q}, \\\\mathbf{K}, \\\\mathbf{V}$ matrices, different from Text2Video-zero which only configures all the frames to attend to the first frame.\\nInterleaved-frame smoother is a mechanism to employ frame interpolation on alternated frames to reduce the flickering effect. At each time step $t$, the smoother interpolates the even or odd frames to smooth their corresponding three-frame clips. Note that the number of frames decreases in time after smoothing steps.\\nHierarchical sampler utilizes a hierarchical sampler to enable long videos with time consistency under memory constraints. A long video is split into multiple short clips and each has a key frame selected. The model pre-generates these keyframes with full cross-frame attention for long-term coherency and each corresponding short clip is synthesized sequentially conditioned on the keyframes.\\n\\n\\nFig. 15.

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstatesht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht‚àí1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniÔ¨Åcant improvements in computational efÔ¨Åciency through factorization tricks [ 18] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,16]. In all but a few cases [ 22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiÔ¨Åcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [ 15] and ConvS2S [ 8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difÔ¨Åcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the Ô¨Årst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The Ô¨Årst is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\n2', metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

We employ a residual connection [ 10] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer(x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\n3', metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\\n‚àödk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1‚àödk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efÔ¨Åcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1‚àödk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneÔ¨Åcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the Ô¨Ånal values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1.

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n‚Ä¢In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n‚Ä¢The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n‚Ä¢Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation Ô¨Çow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to ‚àí‚àû) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by‚àödmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5', metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any Ô¨Åxed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 8] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), withxi,zi‚ààRd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\n6', metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k¬∑n¬∑d+n¬∑d2).

Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiÔ¨Åcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 17] withŒ≤1= 0.9,Œ≤2= 0.98andœµ= 10‚àí9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d‚àí0.5\\nmodel¬∑min(step_num‚àí0.5,step _num¬∑warmup _steps‚àí1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the Ô¨Årst warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop= 0.1.\\n7', metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
